<h1>Project 4: What's Killing My Tomatoes?!</h1>

<h3> Part I: Project Overview and Research Question</h3>
<p><strong>Research Question:</strong> Can a single image of a leaf determine whether your tomato plant is diseased?</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> We plan to tackle this question by developing multiple machine learning models and selecting the best option. Our goal is to enable users to upload images of their own tomato plants and utlize our model to access their plants' health.</p>

<h3>Part II: Our Process</h3>

- Obtain plant disease dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease/data
- Image normalization
  
- Develop and train models
  
- Build a flask app for the model with image upload capabilities.
  
- Build dashboards for each model ccreated to compare and contrast the different models.

<h3>Part III: Models Developed</h3>

- Amanuel - CNN Model
  
- Garrett - Logistic Regression Models
   
- John - CNN Models

- Mohamed - NN Model
   
<h3> Part IV: Limitations and Next Steps</h3>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong>

- Class imbalance (more unhealthy than healthy) 
  
- Training/running time

- Large model size
  
- Time</p>
<p><strong>Next Steps:</strong>

- Utilize Google Colab
  
- Rotate/Flip Images
  
- Additional Training

- Add to MongoDB

- Model size reduction</p>
